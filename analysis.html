              If multiple methods were modeled, Selection Rules would formally encode the choice logic that Norman lumps under “Planning.”<br><br>

              User implicitly prefers quick toggle over Settings due to efficiency.

              Both models represent high-level action planning.<br><br>

              Norman’s “Plan” is realized as the GOMS “Method.” The choice aspect is implicit in GOMS for simple cases, explicit as Selection Rules for complex ones.<br><br>

<!-- Purpose Section -->
<section>
  <h2>Purpose of the Comparison</h2>
  <p>
    This page compares Norman’s Action Cycle with the GOMS model in order to
    understand how user goals, actions, and evaluations are represented in
    interaction analysis.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Explanation Section -->
<section>
  <h2>Conceptual Background</h2>
  <p>
    Norman’s model focuses on the user’s cognitive stages during interaction,
    while GOMS provides a structured description of tasks in terms of goals,
    operators, methods, and selection rules.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Table Analysis Sections -->
<section>
  <h2>Purpose of the Parallel Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    The comparison table demonstrates how Norman’s Execution–Evaluation Cycle
    and the GOMS framework align or diverge when applied to a practical example
    (toggling Wi‑Fi). It shows how Norman’s cognitive stages map onto GOMS’s
    structured task elements, highlighting overlaps in goal setting, planning,
    and execution, while also revealing where Norman provides richer cognitive
    detail that GOMS abstracts away.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Alignment and Divergence</h2>
  <p>
    Three rows in the table are marked with a check (✅) because they represent
    strong conceptual matches:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Goal ↔ GOAL:</strong> Both models capture the user’s intention
        directly.</li>
    <li><strong>Plan ↔ Method &amp; Selection Rules:</strong> Norman’s planning
        stage corresponds to GOMS’s decomposition into methods and choice logic.</li>
    <li><strong>Execute ↔ Operator:</strong> Both models acknowledge the physical
        action as a timed operator.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The other two rows (Specify, and Perceive/Interpret/Evaluate) diverge because
    GOMS does not explicitly model these stages. Norman accounts for them in
    detail, while GOMS assumes perfect perception and interpretation.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Role of Cognitive Detail</h2>
  <p>
    Norman’s model emphasizes the mental work users perform before and after
    execution: specifying actions, perceiving feedback, interpreting results, and
    evaluating outcomes. These stages are critical for understanding usability
    issues, especially the gulfs of execution and evaluation. GOMS, by contrast,
    focuses on expert routine performance and abstracts away these cognitive
    subtleties.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Implications for Usability Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    By blending Norman’s cognitive cycle with GOMS’s structured task analysis,
    designers gain a layered view: Norman explains why usability problems occur,
    GOMS structures how tasks are decomposed, and KLM predicts execution time.
    This integrated perspective helps identify mismatches between user goals and
    system actions, as well as gaps in feedback that hinder effective evaluation.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Legend for Alignment Marks</h2>
  <p>
    In the table, the ✅ symbol indicates a strong conceptual match between
    Norman’s stages and GOMS elements. Rows without a check highlight areas
    where Norman’s model provides additional cognitive detail that GOMS does not
    explicitly capture.
