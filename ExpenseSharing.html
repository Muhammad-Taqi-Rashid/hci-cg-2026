    <h1>Expense Sharing Interface Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      This page analyzes the “Add Expense” interaction in an expense-sharing app
      (like Splitwise) using Norman’s Action Cycle, GOMS, and the Keystroke-Level
      Model (KLM). It also presents a wireframe sketch for the Add Expense screen
      to illustrate design considerations.

    <h2>Interface Design – Add Expense Screen (Wireframe Layout)</h2>
    <img src="Expensescreen.jpg" alt="Expense Screen">
	  <p>
      The Add Expense screen should provide a clear, structured layout to minimize
      cognitive load and social friction:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Title Field:</strong> “Expense Description” (e.g., Dinner at Kababjees)</li>
      <li><strong>Amount Field:</strong> Numeric input with currency symbol (PKR)</li>
      <li><strong>Payer Selector:</strong> Dropdown with profile pictures</li>
      <li><strong>Participants Checklist:</strong> Names with checkboxes and status indicators</li>
      <li><strong>Split Options:</strong> Equal / Custom / Percentage</li>
      <li><strong>Submit Button:</strong> Prominent color, clear label (“Save Expense”)</li>
      <li><strong>Feedback Area:</strong> Confirmation message and updated balances</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This wireframe ensures visibility, error prevention, and social transparency
      in expense recording.

  <p>
    This table applies Norman’s seven stages of action to the “Add Expense”
    task in Splitwise. It highlights cognitive processes, usability challenges,
    and social dimensions such as fairness and trust. Norman’s model explains
    <b>why usability problems occur</b> by focusing on gulfs of execution and
